{"name":"Casimir","tagline":"The Casimir Effect in the plane-sphere geometry ","body":"Casimir\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCasimir Effect in the plane-sphere geometry with perfect reflectors.\r\n\r\nThere is also a website available: http://speicherleck.de/michael/casimir.html.\r\n\r\nYou may cite this software, see: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12476\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe progams in src/ implement the numerics for the Casimir effect in the\r\nplane-sphere geometry with perfect spheres using a scattering approach [1,2].\r\nWe use the same approach, but derive slightly different formulas for the matrix\r\nelement of the round-trip operator that don't need Wigned-d-symbols.\r\n\r\nA sphere of radius R is separated by a distance of L from a plane. The plane is\r\ninfinite in the xy-direction and both plane and sphere are assumed to be\r\nperfect reflectors. The programs calculate the free energy F(T,R/L) in scaled\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThis code is part of my master thesis. It costed much time and much work to\r\nwrite a working and a fast implementation. So, if you find this piece of code\r\nuseful and you use it for plots, please consider to cite my work.\r\n\r\nThe directory talk/ contains a presentation about the Casimir effect in the\r\nplane-sphere geometry in Germand language. The directory report/ contains a\r\nreport about the derivation of the matrix elements of the round-trip matrix,\r\nalso in German language.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nIf you use Linux or Unix, you need the gcc and development libraries and header\r\nfiles for the standard C library. On a Debian-like Linux the command\r\n\r\n    $ apt-get install gcc libc6-dev\r\n\r\nshould install all dependencies. After that, change to the directory src/\r\nand run\r\n\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nto compile the sources. Every program prints out a short usage message when\r\ncalled with the switch -h.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrograms\r\n========\r\n\r\n * casimir\r\n\r\n   Calculate the free energy F(T, L/R) in scaled quantities.\r\n\r\n * casimir_hiT\r\n\r\n   Calculate the free energy F(T->oo, L/R) for very high temperaturs.\r\n\r\n * casimir_logdetD\r\n\r\n  Calculate log(det(D)) for given T, L/R, n and m\r\n\r\n * casimir_tests\r\n\r\n   Run a unit test.\r\n\r\n * pfa.py\r\n\r\n   Implementation of the PFA (proximity force approximation)\r\n\r\n * Casimir.py\r\n\r\n   Python wrapper for casimir\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe software is licensed as GPLv2, see the file LICENSE.
